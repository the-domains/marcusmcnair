[Marcus Sebastian Palmvig Mc Nair][0]

Freelance film worker with a profound interest in Film and TV

production and a solid experienced background working for large

danish production-agencies such as Nordic Film TV, Made In

Valby and Respirator Media & Development. I am currently a

student at Sir John Cass Faculty of art, studying Film &

Broadcast Production.

Further more I've had the pleasure of bringing small personal

projekts such as shortmovies, commercials and music videos to

life in cooperation with other freelance film and TV workers.
